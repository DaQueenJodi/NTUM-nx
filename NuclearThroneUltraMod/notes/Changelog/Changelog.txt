Now describing the exact percentage for bloodlust and luckyshot in mutation description
Changed how humphry's damage increase works, it is now a percentage of the amount of damage you dealt. It used to deal a certain amount of damage per hit and it scaled with skill. Now that skill is used as a percentage to increase the damage that is being dealt. So a heavy crossbow bolt will have a greater damage boost than a pop gun pellet. Currently this is set to 1 skill being 1% of dmg dealt. So with 100 skill you will deal exactly double damage, your revolver will deal 6 dmg instead of 3 dmg and your crossbow will deal 40 dmg instead of 20
